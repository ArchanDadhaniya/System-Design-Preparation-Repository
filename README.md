# System-Design-Preparation-Repository

- **LLD/**: Contains solutions and notes from the LLD playlist, with a focus on design patterns, OOP principles, and low-level architecture.
- **HLD/**: Contains notes from the HLD playlist, with emphasis on scalable architecture, microservices, and high-level design.
- **diagrams/**: Architecture diagrams and system flowcharts for visualization.

## How to Use This Repo

- **LLD**: Focus on the object-oriented design concepts and design patterns by following the [LLD Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6W8uoQQ2c61X_9e6Net0WdYZidm7zooW).
- **HLD**: Study architectural patterns and scalability strategies from the [HLD Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6W8uoQQ2c63W58rpNFDwdrBnq5G3EfT7).
- Each folder contains:
  - **Problem Statement**: Design requirements or questions.
  - **Design Approach**: Explanation of architecture and components.
  - **Diagrams**: Visual representations.
  - **Code Snippets**: Where applicable.

## Revision Strategy

- Follow the playlists systematically, taking detailed notes and documenting solutions.
- Practice designing systems and components by solving design problems and case studies.
- Continuously update diagrams and notes as you progress through the content.

## Tools

- **Languages**: Python, Java (for code snippets).
- **Diagrams**: Lucidchart, Draw.io.
- **Documentation**: Markdown, UML diagrams.

## Future Plans

- Continue to refine and expand notes for each design problem covered in the playlists.
- Add more real-world case studies and advanced system design topics.
